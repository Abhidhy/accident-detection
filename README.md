Overview-
Our main goal of this project is to use deep learning and computer vision to detect accidents on dashcam and report it to nearby emergency services with valid accident images.

Challenges-
1: Our main challenge was to gather accident images and videos and manually categorize images into accident and non-accident frames.

2: To design a deep convolutional neural networks model for this project.
